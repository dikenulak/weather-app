## Mobx based weather app

Weather App based in React JS and Mobx statement library. It uses an open weather API for fetching weather data 
and react-vis from Uber for visualization. Tried to write test using jest and react-testing-library. 

## WIP
** Still need to work on components
** UI refinements. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
